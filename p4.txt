1. Applying aggregate functions on numeric columns:

SELECT SUM(salary) AS total_salary, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary, COUNT(*) AS employee_count FROM employees;

2. Using GROUP BY to categorize data:

SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM employees GROUP BY department;


3. Filtering groups using HAVING:

SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM employees GROUP BY department HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;
